    "A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked waiting for each other to release a resource, resulting in a situation where none of the threads can proceed. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for the same resource, and each thread is holding a resource that the other thread needs to continue. Deadlocks can be difficult to detect and can cause a program to become unresponsive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race Condition:\n",
    "A race condition occurs when two or more threads access the same shared resource at the same time, resulting in unpredictable behavior. Race conditions occur when two or more threads are modifying the same data structure, and the final result depends on the order in which the threads execute. Race conditions can cause data corruption, inconsistency, and other unexpected behavior.\n",

    "Both deadlocks and race conditions can be difficult to detect and debug, and can result in unpredictable behavior and program crashes. To avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design and manage multithreaded programs, and to use synchronization techniques such as locks, semaphores, and barriers to ensure that shared resources are accessed in a thread-safe manner."
