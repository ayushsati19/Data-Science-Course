    "A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and managed using software. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data in a structured and organized manner. Databases are used in various applications, such as websites, mobile apps, e-commerce, healthcare, and finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two different types of databases.\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that use a tabular schema to store and manage data. SQL databases use the SQL language to manage and manipulate data. SQL databases have a defined schema that outlines the structure of the database and the relationships between tables. SQL databases are highly structured and are ideal for applications that require strict data consistency, such as financial transactions, e-commerce, and banking.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (Not only SQL) databases are non-relational databases that store data in a document-oriented or key-value pair format. NoSQL databases do not have a fixed schema and can store data in a flexible and unstructured way. NoSQL databases are ideal for applications that require high scalability and performance, such as social media, gaming, and big data analytics.\n",
    "The main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Model: SQL databases use a tabular schema, while NoSQL databases use a document-oriented or key-value pair format.\n",

    "Schema: SQL databases have a defined schema that outlines the structure of the database, while NoSQL databases do not have a fixed schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: NoSQL databases are highly scalable and can handle large amounts of data, while SQL databases are less scalable and are better suited for applications that require strict data consistency."

For example, in an \"orders\" table, the \"customer_id\" column might be a foreign key that refers to the primary key \"id\" column in the \"customers\" table.
