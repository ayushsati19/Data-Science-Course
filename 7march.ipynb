    "Skewness is a measure of the degree of asymmetry of a probability distribution. In other words, it measures the deviation of a probability distribution from a normal distribution. If a distribution is symmetric, it has zero skewness. If the tail of the distribution is longer on the right-hand side, then it is said to be positively skewed or right-skewed, and the skewness value will be positive. Conversely, if the tail of the distribution is longer on the left-hand side, it is said to be negatively skewed or left-skewed, and the skewness value will be negative. Skewness can be measured using the skewness formula.\n",

Specifically, it measures how much two variables move in the same direction (positive covariance) or in opposite directions (negative covariance). A positive covariance indicates that the variables tend to increase or decrease together, while a negative covariance indicates that one variable tends to increase when the other decreases, and vice versa. However, covariance does not have a standardized scale, which makes it difficult to compare covariances across different datasets. The formula for covariance is:\n",

Correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables on a scale from -1 to 1.

A correlation of 0 indicates no linear relationship between the variables. Correlation is useful because it allows us to compare the strength of the relationship between two variables across different datasets. The formula for correlation is:\n",
