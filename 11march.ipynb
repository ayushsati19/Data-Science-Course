    "Both t-test and z-test are hypothesis tests used to determine whether a sample mean is significantly different from a population mean. However, they differ in the assumptions they make about the sample and population.\n",
    "\n",
    "A z-test is used when the population standard deviation is known, or the sample size is large enough for the sample standard deviation to be a good estimate of the population standard deviation. For example, a researcher wants to test if the mean weight of all blue whales is different from 90,000 pounds, and she knows from previous studies that the standard deviation of blue whale weights is 10,000 pounds. She can use a z-test because she knows the population standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a t-test is used when the population standard deviation is unknown and must be estimated from the sample data. It is also used when the sample size is small, usually less than 30. For example, a researcher wants to test if a new medication reduces the symptoms of anxiety, and she recruits 20 participants with anxiety disorders. She can use a t-test because the population standard deviation of anxiety levels is unknown, and the sample size is relatively small.\n",

    "In a two-tailed test, the null hypothesis does not specify a direction of the effect, and the alternative hypothesis specifies that the effect will occur in either direction.

Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the two teaching methods have a significant difference in student performance using a t-test with a significance level of 0.01."

    "We can interpret this result as meaning that based on the sample data, we cannot say with 99% confidence that the true population means for the two teaching methods are significantly different. However, it is important to note that this does not mean that the teaching methods are necessarily equally effective, as we cannot rule out the possibility of a difference that is smaller than our threshold for significance."
