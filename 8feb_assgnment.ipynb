    "The abc module in Python stands for Abstract Base Classes. It provides the infrastructure for defining abstract base classes (ABCs) in Python. An abstract base class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly, but can be subclassed by concrete classes. It defines the abstract methods that concrete subclasses must implement.\n",

    "We can achieve data abstraction in object-oriented programming by using abstract classes, interfaces, and access modifiers to hide implementation details and expose only relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some ways to achieve data abstraction in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract classes: We can define abstract classes using the abc module in Python, which allows us to define abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses. Abstract classes provide a way to define a common interface for a group of related classes without providing a default implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interfaces: Python doesn't have built-in support for interfaces, but we can achieve the same effect by using abstract classes with no implementation code. Interfaces provide a way to define a set of methods that must be implemented by a class to be considered a valid implementation of the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access modifiers: Python uses underscores (_) to indicate access modifiers for variables and methods. By convention, a single underscore indicates that a variable or method is intended to be used only within the class or module where it is defined, while a double underscore (__) indicates that a variable or method is \"private\" and cannot be accessed outside the class where it is defined. This helps to hide implementation details and prevent outside code from modifying the internal state of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using these techniques, we can achieve data abstraction in Python and create classes that expose only relevant information and hide implementation details. This helps to make our code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain over time."
