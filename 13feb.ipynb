    "Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use built-in exceptions: Whenever possible, use the built-in exceptions provided by Python rather than creating custom exceptions. This makes your code more readable and easier to understand for other developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Catch specific exceptions: Catch only those exceptions that you can handle. Catching a broad exception such as Exception or BaseException can hide errors and make debugging more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use try-except-finally blocks: Use try-except-finally blocks to handle exceptions. The finally block is executed regardless of whether an exception is raised or not, and is useful for cleanup tasks such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Don't use bare except clauses: Avoid using bare except clauses, which catch all exceptions without specifying which ones. Instead, catch only the specific exceptions that you expect to be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Provide helpful error messages: Provide meaningful error messages when an exception is raised. This can help developers understand what went wrong and how to fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Use logging: Use the Python logging module to log exceptions and errors. This makes it easier to debug and maintain your code, especially in larger applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Raise exceptions when necessary: Raise exceptions when necessary, such as when a function or method cannot complete its task. This allows the caller to handle the exception appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Keep exception handling separate: Keep exception handling separate from the main code logic. This makes it easier to read and understand the main code, and also makes it easier to modify or update the exception handling code.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Test exception handling: Test exception handling code to ensure that it behaves as expected in different scenarios, such as when invalid input is provided or when external resources are unavailable.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Document exception handling: Document your exception handling code, including the types of exceptions that can be raised and how they should be handled. This makes it easier for other developers to understand and maintain your code."
