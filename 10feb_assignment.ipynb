    "In Python, the close() function is used to close an open file. It is important to close a file after we are done using it because it frees up system resources that were being used by the file. When a file is opened, the operating system allocates certain resources to that file, such as memory and file handles. If we do not close the file after we are done using it, those resources will remain allocated to the file, which can lead to performance issues or even system crashes if we open too many files without closing them.\n",

    "Closing a file also ensures that any changes we made to the file are saved properly. If we do not close the file, some or all of the data we wrote to the file may not be saved. This can happen because the data is buffered in memory and not written to the file until the buffer is full, or because the file was opened in a mode that does not automatically flush the buffer to disk.\n",
